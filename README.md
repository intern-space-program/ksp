# ksp
Software projects done in Kerbal Space Program, programmed by Johnson Space Center's Intern Space Program club!

## Setup
First, ensure Python 3.8.3, the latest version of pip, and git are installed on your machine.

### Clone the Repo
From the command line, run `$ git clone https://github.com/intern-space-program/ksp.git` to create a ksp directory with the contents of the repo.

### Install the Pipenv Environment
From the `ksp` directory, run:
`$ pip install pipenv`

This will install all of the correct versions of the packages we will be using.
