# Mod Links

The software contained in this repository requires the use of several mods for Kerbal Space Program version 1.9.1.

The following mods are required:
* [kRPC v0.4.8](https://github.com/krpc/krpc/releases/tag/v0.4.8) is required for our software to interact with the game.
* [SDHI Service Module System v4.0.2](https://github.com/sumghai/SDHI_ServiceModuleSystem/releases/tag/4.0.2) is required for the Orion SM and LAS (page says compatible with KSP v1.7.x, tested and working with KSP v1.9.1).
* Kerbal Engineer is great for in-game telemetry readouts. It's a bit of a pain to find a link, so just use the version stored in the `GameData` directory.
* Procedural Parts gives us the custom fuel tanks used in our HLS model.
* ModuleManager (both of them) make the mods play nicely together and with the game.

The following mods are useful for testing, but not required:
* Hyperedit (in Kerbaltek directory) is useful for snapping a ship to a specific orbit without needing to fly it there.
* MechJeb2 gives autopilot controls, which should help with getting the pre-staged vehicles in the testing world to positions you'd like them to be in if there aren't any already at a point you'd like to start from.

# GameData Directory Contents
The `GameData` directory here contains all the mods required. Note it does not contain the copyrighted `Squad` directory, so you'll need to copy the content of this directory into your local `Kerbal Space Program/GameData` directory.
