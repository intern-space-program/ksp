# Ascent-Entry: ES1

## SLS Flies to Kerbin orbit

#### Starting Assumptions

* SLS on pad at space center
* All setup procedures have been completed

Unless otherwise specified, all actions below are completed by SLS. Target values are sometimes provided. Acceptable error values are provided in brackets following the target value.

This document does not include information about SLS staging.

#### Begin Ascent-Entry Event Sequence 1

1. Core Stage (CS) and Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) Throttle Up
2. Release Umbilicals (once some threshold is reached, probably full throttle)
3. Start roll program (Is likely not necessary because Mun orbit along equatorial plane, but will leave here for now)
4. When SRB fuel under 5% of max value, throttle CS down to 67%
5. SRB Sep
6. CS Throttle back up
7. Guidance close-loop start
8. Trajectory with target apogee achieved, CS throttles down
10. CS Sep
11. LAS Jettison
12. Jettison upper stage fairing
13. Enable Reaction Control System (RCS)
14. Maneuver to PRM attitude
15. Inhibit RCS
16. PRM at apogee
17. Enable RCS
18. Extend Solar panels and maneuver to optimal attitude for solar exposure
19. Inhibit RCS
