# Ascent-Entry: ES1

## SLS Flies to Kerbin orbit

#### Starting Assumptions

* SLS on pad at space center
* All setup procedures have been completed

Unless otherwise specified, all actions below are completed by SLS. Target values are sometimes provided. Acceptable error values are provided in brackets following the target value.

#### Begin Ascent-Entry Event Sequence 1

1. Core Stage (CS) Ignition

2. Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) Ignition (cross strapped if applicable in KSP)

3. Release Umbilicals once CS and SRB both reach 100% throttle

4. Start attitude control routine in parallel, maintain 0 degree inclination [0.1]

   A. Use closed loop proportional controller (guidance) to maintain attitude, stay on trajectory

5. When SRB fuel under 5% of max value, throttle CS down to 67%

6. SRB Separation

7. CS Throttle back up, target velocity at pre-determined altitude/velocity table

8. Trajectory with target apogee of 100 km [0.1] achieved, CS throttles down

9. CS Separation

10. LAS Jettison

11. Jettison upper stage fairing

12. Maneuver to PRM attitude

13. Extend Solar panels and maneuver to optimal attitude for solar exposure

14. PRM at apogee

#### End Ascent-Entry Event Sequence 1
