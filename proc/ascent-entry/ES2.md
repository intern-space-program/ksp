# Ascent-Entry: ES2

## Separate from SM and enter Kerbin atmosphere  

#### Starting Assumptions

* Connected to SM at 100km orbit about Kerbin (orbit params TBD by Orbit Team)

Unless otherwise specified, all actions below are completed by CM. Target values are sometimes provided. Acceptable error values are provided in brackets following the target value.

#### Begin Ascent-Entry Event Sequence 2

1. Follow trajectory (previously determined by Orbit Team) towards Kerbin atmosphere

2. Perform thrust maneuvers to ensure target entry angle (TBD by Orbit Team, current target is -2.5deg [0.01])

3. At pre-determined altitude, separate from SM

4. Perform pitch manuever to point heat shield in line with CM velocity vector

5. Enter atmosphere (lifting entry)

6. Deploy droges at 30km altitude

7. Deploy chutes at 20km altitude

8. Splashdown (must meet 10km-to-center requirement) 
 
#### End Ascent-Entry Event Sequence 1
