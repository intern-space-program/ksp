# Orbit Event Sequence 1
## Orion Performs TLI and Rendezvouses with Gateway 

**Starting Assumptions**
- Orion docked to ICPS
- Orion & ICPS in low Kerbin orbit
- Orbit description:
  - 100 km apoapsis [100 m]
  - 100 km periapsis [100 m]
  - 0 degrees inclination [0.1 degrees]


**BEGIN ORBIT EVENT SEQUENCE 1**
1. Attitude maneuver
2. Perform Trans-Lunar Injection burn
  - Fire ICPS
  - Approximately 800-900 m/s delta V required
3. Separate ICPS from Orion
4. Perform OTC (outbound trajectory correction) as needed
5. Orion outbound powered flyby
  // At what distance from Mun to begin?
  // Attitude maneuver?
  // Use of main engine?
6. Gateway orbit insertion burn
  // Attitude maneuver?
  // Main engine burn (thrust, velocity)
  // How long for burn?
  // Match Gateway's orbit
  // What distance away from Gateway?

**END ORBIT EVENT SEQUENCE 1**
