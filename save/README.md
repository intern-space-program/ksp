# World Save

`Intern Space Program` is the world save we'll use to do our full run. `Intern Space Program Testing` has different ships pre-staged at different phases of the mission for ease of testing modularized code.

## How to Install

1. Copy the `<intern-space-program/ksp>/save/Intern Space Program` directory into `<KSP>/saves`.
2. Copy the `*.craft` files in `<intern-space-program/ksp/ships>` into `<KSP>/saves/Intern Space Program/Ships/VAB`.
