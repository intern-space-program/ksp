# Ships

These are the craft files we'll use. If you'd like to use them across all your saves, install the mods from the `ksp/mods` directory and copy the `*.craft` files into your local `<Kerbal Space Program>/Ships/VAB` directory. The ships will be available in the Intern Space Program world save whether or not you do this.
